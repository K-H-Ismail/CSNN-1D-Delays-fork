# CSNN-1D-Delays
Adding delays to 1D convolutional SNNs using DCLS2-1D

### Project progress:
- Repository just started, files are mostly empty only showing structure of project.
- Locally, virtual env with necessary modules and datasets are ok.

### Current work and next milestone:
- currently working on model.py (which specifies the behaviour of an abstract model) and a simple snn.py

- Next milestone would be to have a complete working pipeline for SHD with a basic network, with tests as notebooks in the tests directory.
