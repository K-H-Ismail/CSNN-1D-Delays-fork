# CSNN-1D-Delays
Adding delays to 1D convolutional SNNs using DCLS2-1D

### Project progress:
- CSNN-1D without delays is almost completed

### Current work and next milestone:
- Finishing up CSNN-1D model then upgrading training pipeline.

- Next add model: CSNN-1D-delays


### Current work and next milestone:

- Test using GAvgP+FClayer vs only GAvgP
