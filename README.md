# CSNN-1D-Delays

This is mostly for my offline usage, to take notes and remember what to do next. Also, for Tim to follow the progress of the project.

## To-Do: 

### Priority 1:

- Do some Tests for CSnnNext (for potential bugs)
- Launch multiple runs with a fast-to-run config to get some first results with CSnnNext

### Priority 2: 

- Change sigmas wandb plotting in model.py to all sigmas instead of just the first stage sigma 


### Notes:
- Add delays to the FC layer  ?
- Add weights initialization for Conv layers and for final FC layer
- Decrease Sig during batches instead of epochs
