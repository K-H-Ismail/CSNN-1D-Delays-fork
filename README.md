# CSNN-1D-Delays
Adding delays to 1D convolutional SNNs using DCLS2-1D

### Project progress:
- Complete simple working pipeline with everything

### Current work and next milestone:
- Training and testing current code with CSNN-1D and CSNN-1D-Delays
- Make sure everything is working well, write some basic tests.

- Add depthwise separable convs, either new model or as a configurable part of CSNN-1D-Delays
- Improve wandb logging to spot eventual bugs easily
- Try Using binning


### Notes:
- Adding delays to the FC layer in csnn-1d-delays ?
