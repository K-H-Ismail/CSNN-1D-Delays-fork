# CSNN-1D-Delays

This is mostly for my offline usage, to take notes and remember what to do next. Also, for Tim to follow the progress of the project.

## To-Do: 

### Priority 1:

- Update dwsep_csnn_delays.py
    - use conv1d for the pointwise instead of dcls
    - modify other dependencies

### Priority 2: 

- Update csnn1d.py (with no delays)
- Implement "axonal delays" (archi in discord)
- Add video of pos evolution

### Notes:
- Add delays to the FC layer in csnn-1d-delays ?
- Add weights initialization for Conv layers and for final FC layer
- Decrease Sig during batches instead of epochs
